# Day 01 – Environment Setup & Machine Learning Overview

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a field of Artificial Intelligence where a system learns patterns from data and makes predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

Instead of writing rules manually for every situation, we allow the machine to learn from examples (data).

**Example:**  
Instead of writing rules to detect spam emails, we provide past emails labeled as spam or not spam, and the model learns the pattern by itself.

## Why Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is important because:
- Data is growing faster than humans can analyze
- Many problems are too complex for rule-based programming
- ML systems improve with experience

**Real-world applications:**
- Recommendation systems (Netflix, YouTube)
- Spam detection
- Face recognition
- Fraud detection
- Stock price prediction

## Types of Machine Learning (High-Level)

1. **Supervised Learning**
   - Data is labeled
   - Example: House price prediction

2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - Data is unlabeled
   - Example: Customer segmentation

3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Learning through rewards and penalties
   - Example: Game-playing AI

## How Machine Learning is Different from Traditional Programming

**Traditional Programming:**  
Rules + Data → Output

**Machine Learning:**  
Data + Output → Model  
Model + New Data → Prediction

This shift is what makes ML powerful.
