WDay 02 – Variables, Data Types, Operators & Conditional Statements (Python)
📌 Objective

The objective of Day-02 is to understand how Python stores data, performs operations, and makes decisions using conditions.
These concepts are fundamental for logic building and problem solving.

Topics Covered
##1️⃣ Variables in Python

## 1️⃣ Variables in Python

Variables are used to store values in memory.  
Python automatically determines the data type.

### Example

```python
age = 20
name = "Chanchal"
height = 5.8
is_student = True

print(age)
print(name)
print(height)
print(is_student)
```


No need to declare data type

Variable names are case-sensitive

Must start with a letter or underscore

2️⃣ Data Types in Python
Common Data Types
Data Type	Meaning	Example
int	Integer numbers	10, -5
float	Decimal numbers	3.14
str	Text / string	"Hello"
bool	True or False	True
✅ Example
a = 10          # int
b = 3.5         # float
c = "Python"    # string
d = False       # boolean

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
print(type(d))

3️⃣ Operators in Python
🔹 Arithmetic Operators

Used to perform mathematical operations.

Operator	Meaning
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
/	Division
%	Modulus
//	Floor Division
**	Power
✅ Example
a = 10
b = 3

print(a + b)   # 13
print(a - b)   # 7
print(a * b)   # 30
print(a / b)   # 3.33
print(a % b)   # 1
print(a // b)  # 3
print(a ** b)  # 1000

🔹 Comparison (Relational) Operators

Used to compare values.

Operator	Meaning
==	Equal
!=	Not equal
>	Greater than
<	Less than
>=	Greater than or equal
<=	Less than or equal
✅ Example
x = 5
y = 10

print(x == y)   # False
print(x != y)   # True
print(x > y)    # False
print(x < y)    # True

🔹 Logical Operators

Used to combine multiple conditions.

Operator	Meaning
and	Both conditions true
or	At least one true
not	Reverse condition
✅ Example
age = 22

print(age > 18 and age < 30)   # True
print(age < 18 or age > 60)    # False
print(not age > 18)            # False

4️⃣ Conditional Statements
🔹 if Statement

Executes code only if condition is true.

✅ Example
age = 20

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")

🔹 if-else Statement

Chooses between two paths.

✅ Example
num = 7

if num % 2 == 0:
    print("Even number")
else:
    print("Odd number")

🔹 if-elif-else Ladder

Used for multiple conditions.

✅ Example
marks = 85

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade A")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Grade B")
elif marks >= 60:
    print("Grade C")
else:
    print("Fail")
